# MkAbout
Every MacOS has its own ABOUT THIS MAC page. If u saw my other projects, I have made a [MacOS Monterey](https://github.com/Mengo-Team/MkOsh) Config for my desktop carrying awesome wm. I decided to make one `About This Mac` app for myself, just to make it look cool and more familiar to Mac. I just love the new MacOS Monterey interface and am attempting to make my configs as similar to Mac as possible. Try the whole config too after it.
